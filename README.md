# NumberGuesser

NumberGuesser is a simple random number guessing game written in Python (Python 3.8.8). Small personal project to further develop:
- while loops
- initialization
- proper documentation
- if/elif/else statements
- boolean variable usage

Program works by prompting the user to input a random integer between 1 and 100 (via keyboard) and then provides clues as to where their guess lies with respect to the correct guess on the integer number line.
