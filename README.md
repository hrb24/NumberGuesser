# NumberGuesser

NumberGuesser is a random number guessing game written in Python (Version: Python 3.8.8). 

Overview:
The program works by prompting the user to input a range of values from which a pseudo random integer is generated.
This value range is then outputted before the user is repeatedly prompted to input guesses within the number range (via keyboard).
Clues are provided to guide this process and inform the user as to where their guess lies with respect to the correct guess on the integer number line.

Skills used:
- function driven programming
- parameters/return values
- while loops
- initialization
- proper documentation
- if/elif/else statements
- boolean variable usage
